## **2. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION** *(3 minutes)*

### **Speech Content:**
"The Bayesian paradigm offers four critical advantages for this historical analysis: natural uncertainty quantification, elegant hierarchical structure accommodation, prior information integration, and principled model comparison through information criteria."

### **Detailed Commentary for Section 2:**

#### **2.1 Rationale for Bayesian Methodology - Technical Analysis:**

**Natural Uncertainty Quantification**:
- **Frequentist Limitation**: Confidence intervals don't allow direct probability statements about parameters
- **Bayesian Advantage**: Posterior distributions enable statements like "95% probability that female advantage is between 10-22 times"
- **Mathematical Foundation**: $P(\theta | y)$ provides direct inference about parameter values

**Hierarchical Structure**:
- **Data Reality**: Passengers naturally cluster by embarkation port, violating independence assumptions
- **Statistical Solution**: Random effects $u_j \sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)$ capture port-specific heterogeneity
- **Methodological Sophistication**: Proper uncertainty intervals that account for clustering

**Prior Information Integration**:
- **Theoretical Basis**: Bayes' theorem formally combines prior knowledge with data evidence
- **Practical Implementation**: Historical knowledge about emergency behavior informs prior specifications
- **Regularization Benefit**: Mild shrinkage toward sensible parameter values

**Model Comparison Framework**:
- **Information Theory**: DIC, WAIC, LOO based on predictive accuracy rather than arbitrary thresholds
- **Bayes Factors**: Direct evidence ratios between competing hypotheses
- **Principled Selection**: No multiple testing corrections or p-hacking concerns

#### **2.2 Research Objectives - Strategic Goals:**
- **Quantification**: Move beyond descriptive statistics to probabilistic effect sizes
- **Prediction**: Develop generalizable model for similar emergency scenarios
- **Methodological Demonstration**: Showcase Bayesian advantages over classical approaches
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Complete posterior distributions for all quantities of interest

**Why This Section Matters**: Establishes theoretical superiority of Bayesian approach and positions analysis within modern statistical practice.

## **3. DATASET DESCRIPTION AND EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS** *(4 minutes)*

### **Speech Content:**
"Our dataset reveals striking patterns: 38.4% overall survival, but 74.2% for females versus 18.9% for males, and 63.0% for first class versus 24.2% for third class. However, the missing data patterns themselves tell a story of systematic discrimination."

### **Comprehensive Commentary for Section 3:**

#### **3.1 Data Structure and Characteristics - Statistical Foundation:**

**Dataset Dimensions**: 891 observations × 12 variables
- **Sample Size Adequacy**: Sufficient for stable Bayesian inference with multiple parameters
- **Variable Types**: Mix of continuous (age, fare), categorical (sex, class), and count (family size) variables
- **Response Variable**: Binary survival outcome ideal for logistic regression framework

**Key Variables Analysis**:
- **Survival (Binary)**: Perfect for Bernoulli likelihood in Bayesian framework
- **Passenger Class (Ordinal)**: Clear social hierarchy requiring careful coding strategy
- **Demographics**: Age and sex as fundamental biological/social factors
- **Family Composition**: SibSp + Parch creating family size variable for behavioral analysis
- **Economic Indicators**: Fare as proxy for wealth/social status
- **Embarkation Port**: Natural grouping variable for hierarchical structure

#### **3.2 Missing Data Analysis - Critical Statistical Assessment:**

**Missing Data Patterns**:
- **Cabin (77.1% missing)**: Systematic missingness related to passenger class
  - *Statistical Implication*: Lower-class passengers often lacked assigned cabins
  - *Historical Context*: Reflects 1912 social stratification in ship design
  - *Analytical Decision*: Exclude from primary analysis due to extreme missingness

- **Age (19.9% missing)**: Substantial but manageable missingness rate
  - *Pattern Analysis*: Missing at Random (MAR) assumption testable
  - *Historical Context*: Inaccurate/incomplete passenger manifests common in 1912
  - *Statistical Strategy*: Multiple imputation preserves uncertainty

- **Embarked (0.2% missing)**: Trivial missingness rate
  - *Business Importance*: Port documentation crucial for maritime records
  - *Imputation Strategy*: Mode imputation (Southampton) appropriate for such low rates

**MCAR Test Results - Crucial Statistical Evidence**:
- **Test Statistic**: 598.542
- **p-value**: < 0.001
- **Statistical Conclusion**: Strong evidence against Missing Completely At Random
- **Practical Implication**: Missingness patterns relate to observed characteristics
- **Methodological Response**: Sophisticated imputation required, not simple deletion

#### **3.3 Enhanced Data Preprocessing - Advanced Statistical Methods:**

**Multiple Imputation Implementation**:
```r
mice_imputation <- mice(
  data = titanic_raw %>% select(Age, Sex, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Fare),
  m = 5, method = 'pmm'
)
```

**Theoretical Justification for PMM**:
- **Predictive Mean Matching**: Preserves distributional properties of original data
- **Uncertainty Preservation**: Maintains variability in imputed values
- **Assumption**: Missing At Random (MAR) given observed predictors
- **Advantage**: More honest inference than single imputation methods

**Imputation Quality Assessment**:
- **Original mean age**: 29.70 years
- **Multiple imputation mean**: 29.94 years
- **Distributional preservation**: SD maintained at ~14 years
- **Bias Assessment**: Minimal shift indicates quality imputation

**Feature Engineering Decisions**:
- **Family Size**: SibSp + Parch + 1 (include passenger themselves)
- **Standardization**: All continuous variables centered and scaled for MCMC efficiency
- **Reference Categories**: Third class and male as baselines for interpretation
- **Interaction Terms**: Gender × class interactions for complex social dynamics

#### **3.4 Exploratory Data Analysis - Pattern Recognition:**

**Survival Rate Analysis**:
- **Overall**: 38.4% - establishes baseline tragedy severity
- **Gender Disparities**: 74.2% (F) vs 18.9% (M) - suggests strong protocol effects
- **Class Effects**: 63.0% (1st) vs 47.3% (2nd) vs 24.2% (3rd) - clear hierarchy
- **Age Patterns**: Younger passengers show higher survival rates
- **Family Size**: Non-monotonic relationship suggests optimal group size

**Statistical Implications for Modeling**:
- **Effect Sizes**: Large gender and class effects suggest strong signals in data
- **Interaction Potential**: Different patterns across gender-class combinations
- **Non-linearity**: Family size quadratic terms likely needed
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Port-specific variations warrant random effects

**Why This Section Matters**: Establishes data quality, identifies key patterns, and justifies sophisticated statistical methodology choices.

## **4. STATISTICAL MODEL SPECIFICATION** *(5 minutes)*

### **Speech Content:**
"Our hierarchical logistic regression employs three levels: individual Bernoulli outcomes, linear predictors with fixed effects, and group-level random effects for embarkation ports. The Half-Cauchy prior for variance parameters represents cutting-edge Bayesian methodology."

### **Detailed Commentary for Section 4:**

#### **4.1 Theoretical Foundation - Model Architecture:**

**Model Choice Justifications**:

1. **Binary Outcome → Bernoulli Distribution**:
   - **Statistical Theory**: Natural exponential family for binary data
   - **Link Function**: Logit provides unbounded linear predictor
   - **Interpretability**: Coefficients represent log-odds, exponentials give odds ratios

2. **Logit Link Function**:
   - **Mathematical Properties**: $\text{logit}(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$ maps (0,1) → ℝ
   - **Symmetry**: $\text{logit}(p) = -\text{logit}(1-p)$
   - **Interpretability**: Linear changes in η correspond to multiplicative changes in odds

3. **Hierarchical Structure**:
   - **Data Reality**: Passengers clustered within embarkation ports
   - **Statistical Necessity**: Violates independence assumption of standard GLM
   - **Solution**: Random effects accommodate within-group correlation

4. **Random Effects Specification**:
   - **Port-Level Variation**: Cultural, economic, procedural differences
   - **Unobserved Heterogeneity**: Captures unmeasured port characteristics
   - **Proper Uncertainty**: Inflates standard errors appropriately

#### **4.2 Mathematical Formulation - Complete Statistical Model:**

**Level 1 (Individual-Level Likelihood)**:
$$y_i \mid p_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$$
- **Interpretation**: Each passenger's survival follows Bernoulli trial
- **Parameter**: $p_i$ is individual survival probability
- **Independence**: Conditional on linear predictor, outcomes are independent

**Level 2 (Linear Predictor)**:
$$\text{logit}(p_i) = \eta_i = \mathbf{X}_i^T\boldsymbol{\beta} + u_{j[i]}$$

**Expanded Form**:
$$\eta_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{female}} \cdot \text{Female}_i + \beta_{\text{age}} \cdot \text{Age}_i^* + \beta_{\text{fare}} \cdot \text{Fare}_i^* + \beta_{\text{family}} \cdot \text{FamSize}_i^* + \beta_{\text{family}^2} \cdot (\text{FamSize}_i^*)^2 + \beta_{\text{class1}} \cdot \text{Class1}_i + \beta_{\text{class2}} \cdot \text{Class2}_i + u_{j[i]}$$

**Component Analysis**:
- **β₀**: Baseline log-odds for reference category (male, 3rd class, average age/fare/family)
- **β_female**: Log-odds ratio for females vs. males
- **β_age**: Log-odds change per SD increase in age
- **β_class1, β_class2**: Log-odds ratios for 1st/2nd vs. 3rd class
- **Quadratic Terms**: β_family, β_family² capture non-linear family size effects
- **Random Effect**: u_{j[i]} represents port-specific deviation

**Level 3 (Group-Level Model)**:
$$u_j \mid \sigma_u^2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_u^2), \quad j \in \{1, 2, 3\}$$
- **Assumption**: Port effects drawn from common normal distribution
- **Parameters**: Three port-specific deviations with common variance
- **Interpretation**: Captures systematic differences between Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown

#### **4.3 Prior Specification Philosophy - Advanced Bayesian Theory:**

**Regression Coefficients: β_k ~ N(0, 10²)**

**Theoretical Rationale**:
- **Maximum Entropy Principle**: Normal distribution maximizes entropy given variance constraint
- **Scale Justification**: SD = 10 on logit scale allows odds ratios from exp(-30) ≈ 10⁻¹³ to exp(30) ≈ 10¹³
- **Weakly Informative**: Provides mild regularization without overwhelming data
- **Computational Benefits**: Proper priors ensure well-defined posterior
- **Historical Context**: Allows for extreme effects (women first protocol) while preventing unrealistic estimates

**Random Effect Variance: σ_u ~ Half-Cauchy(0, 5)**

**Methodological Innovation (Gelman 2006)**:
- **Heavy Tails**: Cauchy distribution allows large between-group variation when supported by data
- **Conservative Behavior**: Shrinks toward zero when data suggests little group variation
- **Small Group Robustness**: Performs well with few groups (our 3 ports)
- **Half-Constraint**: Ensures positive variance parameter
- **Scale Parameter 5**: Allows substantial port variation while maintaining computational stability

**Prior Sensitivity Analysis Implementation**:
- **Strong Prior** (τ = 0.001, SD = 31.6): Very diffuse, minimal regularization
- **Moderate Prior** (τ = 0.01, SD = 10.0): Our chosen specification
- **Weak Prior** (τ = 0.1, SD = 3.2): More informative, stronger regularization

**Sensitivity Results**:
| Parameter | Strong | Moderate | Weak |
|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| β_female | 2.691 | 2.684 | 2.671 |
| β_class1 | 2.054 | 2.058 | 2.036 |

**Statistical Conclusion**: Minimal variation across prior specifications demonstrates data dominance and robust inference.

#### **4.4 Data Preparation for MCMC - Computational Optimization:**

**Standardization Strategy**:
- **Continuous Variables**: Center at mean, scale by SD
- **Benefits**: Improves MCMC mixing, makes priors more interpretable
- **Implementation**: `scale()` function creates mean=0, SD=1 variables

**Categorical Coding**:
- **Reference Categories**: Male, 3rd class for interpretable baseline
- **Indicator Variables**: 0/1 coding for clean coefficient interpretation
- **Interaction Terms**: Product of main effect indicators

**Random Effect Indexing**:
- **Port Mapping**: Southampton=3, Cherbourg=1, Queenstown=2
- **Sample Sizes**: S(646), C(168), Q(77) - adequate for random effects estimation

**Quality Assurance**:
- **Range Checks**: Standardized variables have expected ranges
- **Missing Values**: All missing data properly imputed or excluded
- **Data Types**: Appropriate numeric/integer coding for JAGS

**Why This Section Matters**: Establishes sophisticated statistical framework with proper theoretical justification and computational implementation.

## **5. MCMC IMPLEMENTATION AND MODEL FITTING** *(3 minutes)*

### **Speech Content:**
"Our JAGS implementation employs 4 parallel chains with 15,000 burn-in iterations and 30,000 sampling iterations, thinned by 20. This conservative setup ensures reliable posterior inference, confirmed by excellent convergence diagnostics."

### **Detailed Commentary for Section 5:**

#### **5.1 Base Model Implementation - Computational Excellence:**

**JAGS Model Specification Analysis**:
```jags
model {
  # Likelihood Loop
  for(i in 1:N) {
    y[i] ~ dbern(p[i])
    logit(p[i]) <- beta0 + beta_female * female[i] + ...
  }
  
  # Prior Specifications
  beta0 ~ dnorm(0, 0.01)  # precision parameterization
  ...
  
  # Hierarchical Random Effects
  for(j in 1:n_embarked) { 
    u_embarked[j] ~ dnorm(0, tau_u) 
  }
  
  # Half-Cauchy Implementation
  tau_u <- pow(sigma_u, -2)
  sigma_u ~ dt(0, pow(5, -2), 1) T(0,)
}
```

**JAGS Syntax Commentary**:
- **Precision Parameterization**: JAGS uses τ = 1/σ² rather than variance
- **Truncated t-Distribution**: `T(0,)` implements half-Cauchy constraint
- **Vectorized Operations**: Efficient computation through vectorization
- **Parameter Monitoring**: Selective tracking of key parameters for efficiency

**MCMC Configuration Rationale**:
- **4 Parallel Chains**: Enables Gelman-Rubin diagnostic for convergence assessment
- **5,000 Adaptation**: Allows JAGS to tune sampler parameters automatically
- **15,000 Burn-in**: Conservative approach to reach stationary distribution
- **30,000 Sampling**: Adequate for stable posterior summaries
- **Thinning by 20**: Reduces autocorrelation and storage requirements
- **Final Sample**: 6,000 total draws (1,500 per chain)

**Computational Considerations**:
- **Memory Management**: Thinning reduces storage without loss of information
- **Autocorrelation**: Thinning improves effective sample size
- **Convergence**: Multiple chains detect potential convergence failures
- **Reproducibility**: `set.seed(42)` ensures replicable results

#### **5.2 Alternative Model with Interactions - Model Extension:**

**Extended Model Features**:
```jags
# Additional interaction terms
beta_int_fem_c1 * female[i] * class_1[i] +
beta_int_fem_c2 * female[i] * class_2[i]
```

**Interaction Interpretation**:
- **β_int_fem_c1**: Additional log-odds for being female AND first class
- **β_int_fem_c2**: Additional log-odds for being female AND second class
- **Baseline**: Third class females receive only main gender effect
- **Complexity**: Two additional parameters increase model flexibility

**Statistical Rationale**:
- **Social Theory**: Class advantages may differ by gender
- **Historical Context**: "Women first" protocol may interact with social hierarchy
- **Empirical Question**: Do class effects vary by gender?
- **Model Comparison**: Formal testing via DIC comparison

#### **5.3 Prior Sensitivity Analysis Implementation - Robustness Testing:**

**Systematic Sensitivity Framework**:
```r
fit_sensitivity_model <- function(prior_precision, label) {
  # Dynamic model string construction
  # Systematic parameter tracking
  # Consistent MCMC settings
}
```

**Three-Point Sensitivity Design**:
- **Coverage**: Wide range of prior beliefs
- **Comparison**: Same data, different priors
- **Assessment**: Parameter stability across specifications
- **Conclusion**: Data dominance vs. prior influence

**Computational Efficiency**:
- **Reduced Chains**: 2 chains for sensitivity analysis
- **Shorter Runs**: 10,000 iterations sufficient for comparison
- **Key Parameters**: Focus on β_female and β_class1 as most important
- **Automation**: Function-based approach for systematic testing

**Why This Section Matters**: Demonstrates computational competency and establishes reliability of posterior inference through proper MCMC implementation.

## **6. RESULTS AND POSTERIOR INFERENCE** *(7 minutes)*

### **Speech Content:**
"Our posterior analysis reveals striking quantitative evidence: women had 14.7 times higher survival odds than men, first-class passengers had 7.8 times higher odds than third-class, and each standard deviation increase in age reduced survival odds by 38%. These aren't just historical curiosities—they're mathematical proof of systematic discrimination."

| σ_u | 0.710 | 1.014 | (0.02, 3.66) | Yes | Meaningful port variation |

**Statistical Significance Assessment**:
- **Criterion**: 95% credible intervals excluding zero
- **Strong Effects**: Gender, age, both class effects, family size terms
- **Weak Effect**: Fare (absorbed by class variables)
- **Random Effect**: Substantial between-port variation

**Posterior Distribution Properties**:
- **Normality**: All main effects approximately normal (central limit theorem)
- **Precision**: Tight credible intervals indicate strong data evidence
- **Interpretability**: Logit scale coefficients easily transform to odds ratios

#### **6.2 Odds Ratio Interpretation - Substantive Findings:**

**Gender Effect: Mathematical Monument to "Women First"**
- **Coefficient**: β_female = 2.689
- **Odds Ratio**: exp(2.689) = 14.71
- **95% CI**: (9.93, 21.91)
- **Bayesian Interpretation**: "There is a 95% probability that women had between 10-22 times higher survival odds than men"
- **Historical Significance**: Quantifies rigid implementation of maritime chivalry
- **Social Impact**: Demonstrates how gender protocols overrode other considerations

**Class Effects: Economic Hierarchy in Crisis**
- **First Class vs Third Class**:
  - Coefficient: β_class1 = 2.051
  - Odds Ratio: 7.77 (4.29, 14.28)
  - Economic Translation: ~£30 ticket upgrade purchased 677% higher survival odds
  
- **Second Class vs Third Class**:
  - Coefficient: β_class2 = 1.074
  - Odds Ratio: 2.93 (1.83, 4.71)
  - Economic Translation: Moderate upgrade still provided 193% higher odds

**Mathematical Proof of Inequality**: 
- Class effects demonstrate how economic stratification translated directly to life-death outcomes
- Dose-response relationship: Third < Second < First class survival
- Persistence under extreme conditions: Even during disaster, social hierarchy maintained

**Age Effect: Physical Reality Quantified**
- **Coefficient**: β_age = -0.471 per standard deviation
- **Odds Ratio**: 0.62 per 13-year age increase
- **Interpretation**: Each additional 13 years reduced survival odds by 38%
- **Mechanism**: Physical mobility constraints in extreme evacuation conditions
- **Evidence**: Younger passengers better able to navigate ship chaos, reach lifeboats

**Family Size: Behavioral Economics in Crisis**
- **Linear Term**: β_family = 0.829 (positive)
- **Quadratic Term**: β_family² = -1.635 (negative)
- **Shape**: Inverted U-curve with maximum around 2-4 people
- **Interpretation**: 
  - Traveling alone: Reduced survival (no assistance, lower motivation)
  - Small families: Optimal survival (mutual aid without coordination chaos)
  - Large families: Decreased survival (coordination difficulties, slower movement)
- **Theoretical Insight**: Mathematical evidence of cooperation vs. coordination trade-offs

**Random Effects: Cultural Signatures**
- **Overall Variation**: σ_u = 0.710
- **Port-Specific Effects**:
  - Southampton: -0.142 (baseline British port)
  - Cherbourg: +0.298 (wealthier French connections)

- **Interpretation**: Captures cultural, economic, and procedural differences beyond measured demographics

#### **6.3 Interaction Effects Analysis - Complex Social Dynamics:**

**Gender × Class Interaction Results**:

| Interaction | Coefficient | 95% CI | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Female × 1st Class | 2.142 | (0.86, 3.66) | Additional advantage for first-class women |
| Female × 2nd Class | 2.551 | (1.47, 3.77) | Additional advantage for second-class women |

**Interaction Interpretation**:
- **Positive Coefficients**: Class advantages are amplified for women
- **Statistical Evidence**: Both interactions significantly different from zero
- **Social Meaning**: "Women first" protocol didn't eliminate class differences—it amplified them

**Predicted Survival Probabilities**:

| Group | Survival Probability | 95% CI | Social Reality |
|-------|---------------------|---------|----------------|
| Male 3rd Class | **14.9%** | (10.2%, 21.0%) | Near-certain death |

## **7. ENHANCED MODEL COMPARISON AND SELECTION** *(3 minutes)*

### **Speech Content:**
"Model comparison reveals overwhelming evidence for interaction effects. With ΔDIC = -24.08 and a Bayes factor exceeding 169,000, we have very strong statistical evidence that gender and class effects don't simply add—they interact in complex ways reflecting 1912 social dynamics."

### **Detailed Commentary for Section 7:**

#### **Model Comparison Framework - Information Theory Application:**

**DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) Analysis**:

| Model | Deviance | pD | DIC | ΔDIC | Evidence Strength |
|-------|----------|----|----|------|-------------------|

- **Trade-off**: Interaction model improves fit more than complexity penalty

**Evidence Interpretation Framework**:
- |ΔDIC| ≤ 2: Weak evidence for model difference
- 2 < |ΔDIC| ≤ 5: Moderate evidence
- 5 < |ΔDIC| ≤ 10: Strong evidence  
- |ΔDIC| > 10: **Very strong evidence** ← Our case (-24.08)

**Statistical Conclusion**: Overwhelming evidence favoring interaction model

**Bayes Factor Calculation**:
$$BF_{21} \approx \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta DIC\right) = \exp(12.04) \approx 169,231$$

**Bayes Factor Interpretation Scale**:
- BF < 1/10: Strong evidence for base model
- 1/10 < BF < 1/3: Moderate evidence for base model
- 1/3 < BF < 3: Weak evidence either way
- 3 < BF < 10: Moderate evidence for interaction model
- BF > 10: **Strong evidence for interaction model** ← Our case

**Evidence Strength Assessment**:
- **Numerical Evidence**: BF = 169,231 represents overwhelming support
- **Practical Interpretation**: Interaction model is 169,231 times more likely than base model
- **Scientific Standard**: Exceeds all conventional thresholds for strong evidence

**Model Selection Decision Process**:
1. **Statistical Criterion**: ΔDIC > 10 indicates very strong evidence
2. **Substantive Meaning**: Interactions represent realistic social dynamics
3. **Complexity Justification**: Two additional parameters warranted by evidence
4. **Predictive Accuracy**: Improved fit translates to better predictions

**Selected Model Characteristics**:
- **Final Choice**: Interaction model
- **Justification**: Very strong statistical evidence + substantive interpretation
- **Parameters**: 10 total (8 main effects + 2 interactions)
- **Interpretation**: Gender-class interactions reveal complex social hierarchies

**Model Averaging Consideration**:
- **When Appropriate**: Used when evidence is not overwhelming (|ΔDIC| ≤ 5)
- **Our Case**: Evidence too strong for averaging (ΔDIC = -24.08)
- **Decision**: Select interaction model with confidence
- **Alternative**: Could weight predictions, but clear winner exists

**Theoretical Significance**:
- **Additive vs. Interactive Effects**: Social processes rarely purely additive
- **Historical Accuracy**: Interactions capture realistic 1912 social dynamics
- **Statistical Sophistication**: Model selection based on predictive performance
- **Methodological Contribution**: Demonstrates proper Bayesian model comparison

**Why This Section Matters**: Establishes sophisticated model selection methodology and provides strong evidence for complex social interaction patterns.

## **8. MODEL VALIDATION AND POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE CHECKS** *(4 minutes)*

### **Speech Content:**
"Posterior predictive checks demonstrate excellent model adequacy. When we generate 500 replicated Titanic disasters from our model, the predicted survival patterns match observed data with Bayesian p-values near 0.5—indicating our model successfully captures the underlying statistical mechanisms."

### **Detailed Commentary for Section 8:**

#### **Posterior Predictive Check Methodology - Model Validation Theory:**

**Conceptual Framework**:
$$p(y^{rep} | y) = \int p(y^{rep} | \theta) p(\theta | y) d\theta$$

**Methodological Steps**:
1. **Sample from Posterior**: Draw θ⁽ⁱ⁾ from p(θ | y)
2. **Generate Replicated Data**: Draw y^{rep(i)} from p(y^{rep} | θ⁽ⁱ⁾)
3. **Calculate Test Statistics**: T(y^{rep(i)}) for each replication
4. **Compare to Observed**: T(y) vs distribution of T(y^{rep})
5. **Compute Bayesian p-value**: P(T(y^{rep}) ≥ T(y) | y)

**Implementation Details**:
```r
generate_replicated_data <- function(samples_matrix, data_list, model_type) {
  # 500 posterior draws for computational efficiency
  # Full linear predictor reconstruction
  # Bernoulli simulation for binary outcomes
  # Return matrix: 500 replications × 891 passengers
}

## **APPENDIX: DETAILED Q&A PREPARATION**

### **Technical Methodology Questions:**

**Q: "Justify your Half-Cauchy prior choice with mathematical details."**
**A: "The Half-Cauchy(0,5) prior for σ_u follows Gelman (2006)'s recommendation for variance parameters in hierarchical models. Mathematically, it has density f(σ) = (2/π) × (5/(σ² + 25)) for σ > 0. This provides conservative shrinkage when data suggests little between-group variation but allows large variation when supported by evidence. The heavy tails handle uncertainty well with our small number of groups (3 ports), while the scale parameter 5 allows substantial variation while maintaining computational stability."**

**Q: "Explain your missing data mechanism assumptions formally."**
**A: "Our MCAR test (p < 0.001) rejects the Missing Completely At Random assumption, suggesting Missing At Random (MAR) at minimum. Formally, we assume P(R|Y_obs, Y_mis, ψ) = P(R|Y_obs, ψ) where R indicates missingness. Our multiple imputation via predictive mean matching assumes MAR given observed covariates (Sex, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Fare). This is more plausible than MCAR and allows for systematic missingness related to social class while being weaker than Missing Not At Random (MNAR)."**

**Q: "Defend your interaction model specification statistically."**
**A: "The interaction model adds terms β_int_fem_c1 × Female_i × Class1_i + β_int_fem_c2 × Female_i × Class2_i. This allows class effects to vary by gender rather than assuming additivity. Our DIC analysis shows ΔDIC = -24.08, indicating very strong evidence (>10 threshold) favoring interactions. The Bayes factor of 169,231 provides overwhelming confirmation. Substantively, this captures how 'women first' protocols interacted with class-based lifeboat access rather than simply overriding class differences."**

### **Results Interpretation Questions:**

**Q: "How do you interpret the quadratic family size effect?"**
**A: "The positive linear term (β_family = 0.829) and negative quadratic term (β_family² = -1.635) create an inverted U-shape with maximum around 2-4 people. This suggests optimal survival for small families who can coordinate effectively while providing mutual assistance. Solo travelers lack help and motivation, while large families face coordination difficulties that outweigh cooperation benefits. This represents mathematical evidence of behavioral economics principles operating under extreme stress."**

**Q: "What do the random effects tell us about embarkation ports?"**
**A: "The random effects capture systematic differences beyond measured demographics. Southampton (-0.142) represents the baseline British port. Cherbourg (+0.298) shows higher survival, reflecting wealthier French passengers and different boarding procedures. Queenstown (-0.156) shows lower survival, consistent with poorer Irish emigrants. The overall standard deviation σ_u = 0.710 indicates meaningful variation, justifying hierarchical modeling over pooled analysis."**
